    <h1>Economics of Examples: Industrial Organization</h1>
    <h2>Example 1 (Residual demand of Betrand competition under capacity constraint).</h2>
Consider firm \(i\)’s price \(p_i>p_j\), then firm \(i\) is facing a demand
$$\max\{0,\min\{Q(p_i)-k_j,k_i\}\}$$
This seems to be eccentric at first glance. We illustrate corresponding three possibilities here:
    <ul>
<li>when firm \(j\)’s capacity can satisfy whole market demand, firm \(i\) is facing zero demand: \(Q(p_i)\leq Q(p_j)\leq k_j \implies Q(p_i)-k_j\leq 0\). Therefore, \(D_i(p_i,p_j)=0\);</li>
<li>when firm \(j\) can not cater for whole market demand and firm \(i\) sets a relative “high” price, firm \(i\) is facing a market demand of \(Q(p_i)-k_j\);</li>
<li>when firm \(j\) can not satisfy whole market demand and firm \(i\) imposes a “low” price (of course, it should be greater than \(p_j)\), firm i is then supplying a market demand of \(k_i\).</li>
    </ul>
For more descriptive example, consider the following situation: a market demand \(Q(p)=1-p\) and capacity constraint \(k_1=k_2=0.3\). The following three situations correspond to residual demand of \(0\), \(Q(p_i)-k_j\), and \(k_i\).
    <ul>
<li>\(p_1=0.8\) and \(p_2=0.7\): residual demand of firm \(1\) is \(0\);</li>
<li>\(p_1=0.6\) and \(p_2=0.5\): residual demand of firm \(1\) is \(0.1=Q(p_1)-k_2\);</li>
<li>\(p_1=0.2\) and \(p_1=0.1\): residual demand of firm \(1\) is \(0.3=k_1\).</li>
    </ul>
